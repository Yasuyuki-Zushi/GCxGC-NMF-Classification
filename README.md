# GCxGC-NMF-Classification
An R code for classifying GCxGC data based on a NMF algorithm


A user is requested to locate 2 categorized data in the input folder: 1. GCxGC data (.csv) to make NMF classes, 2. GCxGC data (.csv) to be classified into the prepared NMF class.
These GCxGC data should be taken by same conditions on GC run and detector.


Open "Just_Run_Me.r" file. Modify "Folder_location", so that it is adjusted for your PC environment.
Then, just run the code in R.


Test data set is involved in this version, therefore, the user can quickly experience how it works.
